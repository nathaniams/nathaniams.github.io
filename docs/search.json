Quite fitting, as I have always been passionate about learning and expanding my education in data discovery, literacy and coding. It is such an exciting time to learn with the growth of data and new technology such as Artificial Intelligence. In my career I have been a casual coder, finding opportunities to test out my skills when able. I hope to bring my enhanced knowledge and expanded coding skills back to the workplace to teach others and improve upon my organization’s objectives."

    "section": "Purpose of Redesign",
    "text": "Purpose of Redesign\nThe objectives of redesigning these tables are to provide informative graphs to help readers further interpret the data. By ensuring the graphs focus on accurate comparisons, simplified and uncluttered graphs, and appropriate context to keep the readers engaged. This will help readers make informed decisions about their next visit to a National Park.\n\nRedesign of Table 1\nIn this redesign, a horizontal bar chart is used. This allows for easy reading of the park names while still arranging the number of incidents from high to low. Also, this chart provides quick comparison for readers to easily compare bar lengths. In the book, Storytelling with data, “Our eyes compare the end points of the bars, so it is easy to see quickly which category is the biggest, which is the smallest, and also the incremental difference between categories.” [3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesign of Table 1, another look\nIn this redesign, table 1 is transformed to provide a map view of the data. This takes a different approach to understanding the search and rescue incidents from table 1. Here we are still using the same data from table 1, but instead of representing the park the state is used instead to represent states with the most incidents. This is another way to visualize the information from table 1. Another consideration is that some National Parks span more than one state. In this map, only one state was selected for each National Park. If data was available for each of the search and rescue events, then we could plot those events and have a more exact number of what state the incidents occurred in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesign of Table 1, a better look\nHere is another way to visualize the information that blends location while still providing the number of Search and Rescue Incidents for the top parks. The use of an interactive map is to allow readers not only to understand the parks with the highest number of incidents, but to help explore where those parks are and how large they area. The interactive map allows the reader to zoom in and out and pan around the map. Each marker has the name of the Park and the number of incidents. *Note: Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park were originally combined in the table. However, the NPS has them as separate parks.Therefore the number of incidents were divide between the two parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesign of Table 2\nIn table 2 we see 20 states listed with the total number of Search and Rescue incidents from 2018-2020. Here it seems like the visual is on the right track; however, after counting the states there are only 19 highlighted! Oh yes, sneaky Alaska and Hawaii are not represented in this map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to get the two states in the chart, without zooming too far out and losing the state-level resolution, another approach to the map view must be taken using library(usmap) and library(sf). Now we have all top 20 states properly represented on the map. To reduce clutter and unnecessary information [3], the x-axis and y-axis were removed. This is not only good practice to reduce clutter but another consideration is the placement of Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. They are placed toward the bottom of the map view to include them in the graph not to represent their actual locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, an unusual error occurred when trying to render from R Studio to html. The map was missing the data overlay. The map generated without issues in R Studio. For a workaround, I saved the ggplot as an image and included in the qmd. After revisiting this issue on the Redesign Code page, the issue was discovered in the variable name for the dataframe that was being used. After renaming the variable the issue was resolved."

For simplicity general definition are provided:\nArrest - When a person is taken into custody to answer for an offense or when there is a deprivation or restraint of a person’s liberty in any significant way.\nCitation - Formal notice issued by law enforcement officer for a violation of law, typically related to traffic laws or other minor offenses. Typically requiring a violator to appear in court or pay a fine.\nWarning - When a violation, typically minor, has been made but an officer issues a warning rather than a citation.\nThe following attributes were key to the research and conducted:\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nData Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDate\nDate\nDate of offense\n\n\nTime\nChr\n123\n\n\nOffense\n1\n1"
