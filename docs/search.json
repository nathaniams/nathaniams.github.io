    "text": "My name is Nathania Stephens. I go by Nat. I am a graduate student at George Mason University. I am pursuing a MS in Data Analytics Engineering. Quite fitting, as I have always been passionate about learning and expanding my education in data discovery, literacy and coding. It is such an exciting time to learn with the growth of data and new technology such as Artificial Intelligence. In my career I have been a casual coder, finding opportunities to test out my skills when able. I hope to bring my enhanced knowledge and expanded coding skills back to the workplace to teach others and improve upon my organization’s objectives."
